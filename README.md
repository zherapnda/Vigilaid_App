# Vigilaid 🚨

**AI-Powered First Aid for Everyone**

---

## 📱 Overview

Vigilaid is an AI-powered first aid application that transforms anyone into a confident first responder. Created for the 2025 Congressional App Challenge, Vigilaid addresses a critical public health gap: while **70% of Americans feel helpless in emergencies** and **59% of injury deaths are preventable** with basic first aid, most people never receive proper training.

### The Problem

- 70% of Americans lack basic first aid knowledge
- 59% of injury deaths could be prevented with timely first aid
- Only 18% of Americans are currently trained in CPR
- 80% of cardiac arrests happen at home, but only 46% receive help before paramedics arrive

### The Solution

Vigilaid makes lifesaving knowledge accessible, memorable, and actionable through four intelligent systems:

1. **AI Detection** - Recognizes emergencies in real-time
2. **Interactive Education** - Makes first aid unforgettable
3. **Community Forum** - Shares real rescue experiences
4. **Adaptive Personalization** - Tailors content to individual risks

## 🧠 ML Model Training

The emergency detection model requires training before use:

### 1. Prepare Training Data

```bash
cd ml_models
python prepare_data.py --data_path ./training_data
```

### 2. Train the Model

```bash
python train_model.py --epochs 100 --batch_size 32
```

### 3. Convert to TensorFlow Lite

```bash
python convert_to_tflite.py --model_path ./models/emergency_detector.h5
```

### 4. Copy to App

```bash
cp ./models/emergency_detector.tflite ../app/assets/models/
```

## 🎯 Key Features Implementation

### Emergency Detection Pipeline

```javascript
// Simplified audio detection flow
AudioService.startListening() 
  → Capture audio buffer 
  → Convert to spectrogram 
  → Run through TensorFlow Lite model 
  → Analyze prediction confidence 
  → If emergency detected > 85% confidence:
      → Get GPS coordinates
      → Send alert to emergency contacts
      → Display emergency instructions
```
